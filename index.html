    <header>Human's best friend!</header>

    <p>If you have ever walked down the road, and made eye contact with a dog, then you will understand where I am coming from. When their big brown eyes lock with yours, and their tail starts wagging frantically; come on admit it, you feel that warm fuzzy feeling too!</p>
    <p>I have 2 dogs, Bailey and Brandy. They are beagles and are definitely my best friends. They make sure I stay the right wieght... by eating my food when I am not looking. They help me do the gardening... by digging up anuthing that looks like a weed (plant). Finally they keep me safe... by baking at absolutely any sound including my own breakthing.</p>
